# input_output_combine
In a robotic factory warehouse, where input is continuous (automated production 24h), and output (custom deliveries) is intermittent, a robot can perform a combined movement. This combined movement increases the efficiency. But how much a combined movement can be done, depending on time per day when output is done? The program calculates this.
